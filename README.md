# Mapping Data to Components 

The goal of this project is to build a styled emoji dictionary website. A styles.css .The main objective is to use the knowledge of mapping components in React to dynamically render emoji entries.


# This Project helped to practice:

Extracting reusable components in React.
Passing data via props to components.
Importing and exporting JavaScript modules.
Using the map() function to render lists of components dynamically.


# Key Takeaways

Created a reusable React component to represent individual emoji entries.
Used props to pass dynamic data such as emoji, name, and description to components.
Imported and mapped through an array of emoji data to dynamically render components.
Applied best practices like assigning unique keys when rendering lists in React.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
